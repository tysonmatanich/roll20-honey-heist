# roll20-honey-heist

[Roll20](https://roll20.net/) character sheet for [Honey Heist](https://gshowitt.itch.io/honey-heist), the one-page RPG by Grant Howitt. 

## Dungeon Scrawl Styles

Feel free to use [map-styles.ds](map-styles.ds) with [Dungeon Scrawl](https://probabletrain.itch.io/dungeon-scrawl) to create custom Honey Heist maps that match the style used in this template.

## CodePen 
I used CodePen to edit and figure out the styling before integrating into Role20. These pens include the related Role20 stylesheets to help best emulate the environment.
